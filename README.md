# Compilation-Techniques-Project
CT.c is a lexical analyzer implemented in C. This program is designed to read through an input source code file and break it down into tokens for further syntactic and semantic analysis in a compiler. The file contains various functions and structures to manage the lexical process, including token creation, memory management, and error handling.
